# Decentralized Crop Insurance for Smallholder Farmers

This project implements a blockchain-based crop insurance system designed specifically for smallholder farmers. The system provides automated, transparent insurance coverage that triggers payouts based on verifiable weather events, eliminating the need for traditional claim adjusters and reducing administrative costs.

## Core Components

1. **Farmer Registration Contract**
    - Records essential details of small agricultural operations
    - Stores information about farm location, size, and crops grown
    - Creates unique digital identities for participating farmers

2. **Weather Data Oracle Contract**
    - Provides verified climate information from multiple trusted sources
    - Monitors key parameters including rainfall, temperature, and extreme weather events
    - Ensures data integrity through consensus mechanisms

3. **Automated Claim Processing Contract**
    - Triggers payouts automatically based on predefined weather conditions
    - Eliminates manual claims filing and reduces processing time
    - Creates transparent, auditable record of all insurance activities

4. **Premium Calculation Contract**
    - Adjusts insurance rates based on location-specific risk factors
    - Considers crop type vulnerability to different weather events
    - Enables fair, data-driven pricing for farmers in various regions
